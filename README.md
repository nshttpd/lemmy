### Lemmy 2 - Electric Boogaloo

#### What?

Lemmy is a highly opinionated deployment tool for Kubernetes. It's currently a work in progress being rebuilt during
spare cycles, hence the **2**.

#### Why?

Enough people seem to want it that have heard about it from when it was previously built. Currently attempting
the [buffalo theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Beer/Selected_quote/5) to rebuild it in Go and
AngularDart just to see if I can. The previous incarnation was created at a now defunct
[startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yik_Yak) first as a hacked together home built version of ansible tower
to deploy containers into AWS auto scaling groups which later morphed itself into what Lemmy was. So, why not.
